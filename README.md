## 🌐 Base Mainnet Reality

**Important Note**: Base mainnet is a newer chain and doesn't have the same liquidity depth as Ethereum mainnet. The bot currently encounters:

- **Limited USDC-DAI direct pools** - Most swaps go through WETH
- **Lower liquidity** - Smaller trade sizes recommended
- **Fewer DEX options** - Primarily Uniswap V3 and Sushiswap V2

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Set up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
WALLET_KEY=your_private_key_here
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xb745F770E572e50FaBD416B6e2deEC1Bf175C733
TRADE_AMOUNT=100
MIN_PROFIT=5
CHECK_INTERVAL=30000
```

### 2. Start the Bot
```bash
npm start
# or
node bot.js
```

### 3. Test DEX Connections
```bash
node test-dex.js
```

## 📊 Current Bot Behavior

The bot now:
1. **Verifies network connection** to Base mainnet
2. **Attempts real DEX price fetching** from Uniswap V3 and Sushiswap V2
3. **Falls back to alternative paths** (USDC→WETH→DAI) when direct pools fail
4. **Uses fallback pricing** when all DEX calls fail
5. **Continues monitoring** despite individual failures
6. **Provides detailed logging** for debugging

## 💡 Recommendations for Better Performance

### 1. Increase Liquidity
- Consider providing liquidity to USDC-DAI pools on Base
- Use WETH as an intermediate token for better routing

### 2. Adjust Parameters
- **Lower trade amounts** (start with 10-50 USDC)
- **Lower profit thresholds** (start with $1-2)
- **Shorter check intervals** for more frequent opportunities

### 3. Monitor Gas Costs
- Base mainnet gas is cheaper than Ethereum but still significant
- Factor gas costs into profit calculations

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"No valid pool found"** - Normal on Base mainnet, bot handles gracefully
2. **"Price fetch failed"** - Bot uses fallback pricing
3. **"Not profitable"** - Normal when gas costs exceed arbitrage opportunity

### Solutions:
- The bot automatically handles most failures
- Check Base mainnet liquidity for your target token pairs
- Consider using WETH intermediate paths

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

The bot includes:
- Real-time profit/loss calculations
- Gas cost estimation
- Network health monitoring
- Detailed logging for all operations

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Owner-only execution** - Only you can trigger arbitrage
- **Emergency stop** - Built-in safety mechanisms
- **Profit thresholds** - Prevents unprofitable trades
- **Gas limits** - Prevents excessive gas consumption

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Monitor the bot** for a few days to understand Base mainnet patterns
2. **Adjust parameters** based on observed opportunities
3. **Consider providing liquidity** to improve arbitrage opportunities
4. **Explore other token pairs** that might have better liquidity

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the detailed logs in the console
2. Verify your `.env` configuration
3. Ensure you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
4. Check Base mainnet status and liquidity
